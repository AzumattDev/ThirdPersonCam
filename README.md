# Description

## A work in progress ThirdPerson mod. Slapped it together pretty quickly. There are some quirks, but it is usable.

### Known Issues:

- **The camera will clip through walls.**
- **When shooting, your gunfire is as if you are in first person and is spawned at the center of screen. This is
  unfortunately an issue in the base game.**
